Choices made
1. histogram computation height: Think of robustness in a sense sometimes the lanes will not be in lower few pixel part.
1. [also addressed in lecture 35 with convolution) leftx_base, rightx_base are taken at "midpoint" using "max". Both chocies can be thought again, 
e.g., instead of max per column take aggregation of few columns to account for line thickness or Sliding window in histogram 
of certain width (another hyper parameter) to determine a position where we accumaulate maximum pixels.
1. Window size: vertical (nWindows) and horizontal (margin), 
1. minpix to be found in a window to re-center the x positions.
1. When you reuse the polynomioal lane estimate from previous frame the margin can be different than the window margin in first frame. Also, you can have a minpix_2 threshold to determine 
if we need to re-do the sliding window again since the older estimate is less trust worthy.

# Propagation of belief
1. Initial prior on the first layer of first frame is uniform.
1. Histogram is an observation. Convolution on histogram is just ML boosting of SNR by assuming averaging imporves signal but not noise.
1. normalize the averaged histogram to generate distribution of possible center positions. 

Iterate over following two steps until end of frame
1. S1: Update distribution based on observation. picking one center per lane is like putting delta posterior distribution.
1. S2: Take new observation (either uniformly or based on posterior distribution)

In new frame prior can be last frame posterier with some confidence.
Confidence can be based on how many pixels are in the estimated zone. If it is clear that we have detected a strong lane line we can have a more concentrated posterior.
